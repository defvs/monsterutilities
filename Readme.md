## Usage

[Download](http://monsterutilities.bplaced.net/downloads?download)

> This is a pre-Release, you may encounter bugs. 
If you do, open an issue here or send feedback from inside the application. 
The latter will automatically include logs, which reside in `TEMP/monsterutilities/logs`

To run it, you need to have Java 8 by Oracle installed on your computer.

Read the initial guide and follow the tooltips. Improved user-friendliness is in development ;)
